# Semi-automatic methodology:
This file provided a UI to simplifier the medical image processing during design of prosthsis. In this Userinterface, with simple click, reference points can be exported both in .csv file which could work well in a CAD environment, and in .json file which could be reloaded in 3D slicer.
# Running
For running the code you need to append source code folders that contain module .py files to “additional module paths”.
Reset the pathway of folder where you want save the output files in the source code 'Automatic_methodology.py'. 
To have a clear instruction for placement of reference points, a diagrammatic sketch has been uploaded as 'import image.png'. Edit the path way of the image in 'Automatic_methodology.ui'.
